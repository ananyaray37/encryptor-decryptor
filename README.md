# Encryptor-Decryptor
A secure data encryption and decryption tool built using Java (backend) and JavaScript (frontend). This project allows users to safely convert plain text into unreadable cipher text (encryption) and restore it back to its original form (decryption), ensuring confidentiality and secure communication between client and server.
 Key Features
~ Symmetric Encryption (AES/Base64) for secure message conversion

~ Decryption Module to retrieve original content from cipher text

~ Frontend Interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for real-time encryption

~ Java Backend implementation for deeper system-level encryption

~ Client-Server Secure Communication Simulation

~Technologies Used
Java (Encryption/Decryption logic)

JavaScript (Client-side cryptography using CryptoJS)

HTML/CSS (User Interface)

Optional: Spring Boot or Servlets (for full backend integration)

~Use Cases
Secure data sharing between systems or users

Demonstration of cryptography principles

Educational tool for understanding real-world encryption
